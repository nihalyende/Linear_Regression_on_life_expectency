Life Expectancy Analysis
This project analyzes life expectancy data, aiming to uncover the various factors that influence it. Using Multiple Linear Regression, we explore how certain socioeconomic and health-related variables contribute to variations in life expectancy across countries. The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Kaggle website, originally developed by the World Health Organization (WHO). Our focus is on the data from 2015.

Project Overview
Life expectancy is one of the most vital indicators of human well-being, influenced by a wide range of factors like economic status, healthcare systems, education, and lifestyle choices. This project aims to:

Investigate key factors affecting life expectancy.
Build a Multiple Linear Regression model to analyze relationships between the independent variables (features) and life expectancy.
Provide insights that could inform policymakers, health experts, and researchers.
Dataset
The dataset contains information collected from multiple countries across the world, including variables such as:

Country Name
Status (Developed or Developing)
Schooling (Years of education)
Life Expectancy
GDP
Alcohol Consumption
Adult Mortality
HIV/AIDS Prevalence
Health Expenditure
The data spans from the year 2000 to 2015, but for the purpose of this analysis, we use data for the year 2015 only.

Data Source
The dataset is sourced from the Kaggle website, originally developed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
Data Preprocessing
Before building the model, we performed data cleaning and preprocessing steps:

Removed missing or inconsistent data points.
Dropped redundant or irrelevant columns.
Processed categorical variables (e.g., country status) into a format suitable for regression modeling.
Handled outliers and transformed variables where necessary to improve model performance.
Methodology
We used Multiple Linear Regression to understand the relationship between the dependent variable (life expectancy) and multiple independent variables such as schooling, adult mortality, healthcare spending, etc.

Key Steps Involved
Data Exploration:

Visualizing distributions, trends, and relationships in the dataset.
Identifying key independent variables likely to impact life expectancy.
Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning the dataset to handle missing values and outliers.
Feature engineering to create new variables where necessary.
Model Development:

Building a Multiple Linear Regression model to identify relationships between life expectancy and the independent variables.
Performing statistical tests (e.g., R-squared, p-values, and adjusted R-squared) to evaluate the model's performance and the significance of the variables.
Model Evaluation:

Validating the model using various performance metrics.
Interpreting the coefficients to understand the impact of each independent variable on life expectancy.
Key Insights
From the model, we identified that several factors have a significant influence on life expectancy:

Education (Schooling): More years of schooling are associated with higher life expectancy.
Health Expenditure: Countries that invest more in healthcare tend to have longer life expectancy.
Adult Mortality: Higher adult mortality rates correlate with lower life expectancy.
Status: Developing countries generally have lower life expectancy compared to developed countries.
Limitations
The dataset has missing values and potential biases due to underreporting in some countries, particularly for lesser-known or developing countries.
The regression model is limited to the available variables in the dataset, and many other factors that may influence life expectancy (such as environmental factors or access to clean water) are not considered.
Data is for the year 2015 only, so trends over time are not captured.
The model is not perfectly reliable and should be used with caution when making predictions or policy decisions.

Future Improvements
